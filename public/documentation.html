    <h1>Building My First API</h1>
        <h2>
            <p>The objective of this achievement is to build a server-side application. <br>
               This application in particular is for a movie application. The application <br>
               will provide users with access to information about movies, directors, and <br>
               different genres.  Users will be able to create an account, update their personal <br>
               information, and create a list of their favorite movies.</p>
